# Operating-Systems-Project
This repository contains two programming assignments completed as part of the Operating Systems course.  
Both projects are implemented in **Java** and demonstrate key OS concepts.

## Projects
1. Process Scheduling Simulator
   Simulates CPU scheduling using SRTF (Preemptive SJF) with performance metrics and Gantt chart visualization.

2. Memory Fragmentation Simulator
   Simulates memory management using Fixed Partition with First-Fit, Best-Fit, and Worst-Fit allocation strategies.

Each project folder contains the source code and a detailed README describing the project and my contributions.  
These projects were completed as **part of a team**, and my role/contributions are clearly outlined in each project's README.
